    <p>It is with a heavy heart that the Find Your
        Activity team have had to close our startup and our journey
        together is over for now.</p>
    <p>The COVID-19 lockdowns impacted our growth plans, but we
        continued on  providing a valuable service to many activity
        providers across the UK.</p>
    <p>As they say, better to have tried and failed than to have never
        tried at all.</p>
    <p>Even though this might be considered a failure, to us it will always
        remain an incredible experience.  The team has grown in more
        ways than we could have imagined, and we have memories that
        will live on forever.</p>
    <p>We have thoroughly enjoyed supporting the amazing activity
        providers by sharing their services and connecting individuals with
        their perfect activities.  We wish them all the success in the future
        driving their own businesses forward.</p>
